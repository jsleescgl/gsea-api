# GSEA API for Pandas
Pandas API for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis in Python (GSEApy, cudaGSEA, GSEA)

- This python wrapper around various GSEA implementations aims to provide a unified programming interface,
built using the pandas DataFrames and a hierarchy of Pythonic classes.
- The file exports were written with performance in mind using lower level numpy functions where necessary.
- The project is in work-in-progress state and scheduled to have a major refactor and a more complete documentation.
